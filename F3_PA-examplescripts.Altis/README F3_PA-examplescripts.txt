The scripts have all been placed down in the example mission for you to understand how to use them.

included scripts:
- COS: Spawns parked cars in a radius
- GVS: Vehicle service system
- rooftopStaticWeapons: Spawns static guns on rooftops in a radius
- MCCfr_paratroops: spawns AI infantry attack, inserted by helicopter
- pa_fn_supply: Drops supply crate on specified location
- LV SpawnAI_BuildingAuto: Spawns AI in buildings and disables their movement in a radius
- p_fnc AI spawn scripts: several scripts that spawn AI on patrols or attack
- pa\ace_arsenal: helper scripts to make limited ACE arsenals easier to use

The mission example also includes a few example setups you may find useful that don't use scripts:

- Set AI as a captive or unconcious
